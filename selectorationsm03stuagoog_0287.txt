conflicts between them. As Milo was on his way to Lanuvium, of
which he was dictator or chief magistrate, he.was met near Bovil-
lae by Clodius, who was returning to Rome. Both, as usual, were
accompanied by armed attendants, but Milo's party was the stronger.
The leaders had passed each other peaceably, but Eudamus and
Birria, professional gladiators, walking in the rear of Milo’s party,
picked a quarrel with some of the followers of Clodius, and the
conflict soon became general. Clodius, immediately turning back,
was wounded in the shoulder, his party was put to ssight and took
refuge in a neighboring house, which Milo ordered his meu to
attack. Clodius was dragged out and killed, and his body left
lying on the road. It was soon after carried to Rome, where an
excited mob conveyed it to the senate-house and burned it on a
funeral-pile made of the benches, tables, and books3 the senate-
house itself and several adj0ining buildings being reduced ιο ashes.
Amid this confusion the senate created Pompey sole consul, whose
first object was ιο quiet the publio disorders. He then published
several new laws, one of which was that a special commission
should be appointed to inquire into the circumstances os Clodius’s
death, and that a special Judge should preside over it. Pompey
himself attended the trial with a strong guard ιο preserve the
peace, while thousands of spectators from all parts of Italy thronged
the Forum during its continuanee. Cicero repaid the former ser-
vices of Milo by undertaking his defence. But on this occasion
his usual success as an orator deserted him. The imposing array
of soldiers and the rude outcries and violent demonstrations of the
clodian faction intimidated him; he lost his presence of mind and
made but a weak defence. Milo was condemned, and retired into
banishment at Marseilles. Cicero afterwards expanded and em·
bellished the oration, and sent it, in its present form, to Milo, who
only remarked, “ 1 am glad this was not spoken, since 1 must have
been acquitted, and then have never known the delicate ssavor of
these Marscille-mullets.''

The oration was delivered in B. C. 52, and was considered both
by Cicero himself and by many of his contemporaries as the finest
effort of his genius.
