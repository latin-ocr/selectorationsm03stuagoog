PREFAGE.

HE text presented in the following Orations is substantially
that of Kayser, “ex optimis libris manuscriptis,” as ex-
hibited in the joint labors of Baiter and Kayser in the Tauch-
nitz editiones the works of Cicero. The superior excellence
of that text is assured by the fact, that the learned editors had
the advantage of collating a larger and richer supply of manu·
scripte than any of their predecessors in the same line of labor.
A resort to selected readings therefore became undesirable‚
and only in three or four places did the lections of Halm seem
preferable.

In the preparation of the Notes, the method adopted in the
preceding volumes of the series has been steadily pursued.
Naturally, however, the assistance given is not of so elementary
a character as that in the Caesar. The student of Cicero is
reasonably presumed capable of appreciating nicer distinctions,
whether of construction or of style. References are freely
made to the grammars most in use in this country, and such
translations of difficult words and passages, and explanations
of peculiarities of syntax, are given, as the student has a right
to expect. Biographical and historical allusions are always
explained where necessary-3 and in particular the subject of
antiquities‚ a knowledge of which 'throws so much light upon
the ancient authors, has received a large share of attention.
with the assistance thus rendered, and a faithful use of his
grammar and lexicon by the student, he cannot fail to read
