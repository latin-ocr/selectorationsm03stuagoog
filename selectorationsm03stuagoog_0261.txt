INTRODUGTION.

Astus meus Annuus was a Greek poet, born at Antioeh, in
Syria, about Β. C. 120. He came to Rome in Β. C. 102, and was
one of the instructore of Cicero. He was received into the best
families of the capital, particularly by the Luculli, the poet taking
their gentile name, Licinius. Some time afterward, through the
influence of Lucullus, the renowned Roman general, he was en-

passed conferring the Roman franchise on all who were citizens
of any of the federate cities, (i. e., Italian cities connected with
Rome by treaty,) provided they had a domicile in Italy and should
give their names to the praetor within sixty days after the passage
of the act, With these conditions Archias complied. Notwith-
standing this, a person named Gratius brought against him the
charge of assuming the citizenship illegally. Cicero undertook his
defence, but as the register of Heraclia had been destroyed by fire
in the Marsian or Social War, he could present but little direct
proof. The orator, therefore, takes occasion to digress eloquently
and beautifully into the fields of literature and the praises of
poetry, and to extol the talents and merits of Archias. On this
oration Cicero “ expended all his resources of art, taste, and skill.’' x
