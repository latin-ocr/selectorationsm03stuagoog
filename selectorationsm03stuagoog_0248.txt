1NTRODUOT10N.

Ama the departure of Catiline, Lentulus and the other eon·
spirators went vigorously towork to execute his instructions. Thero
happened to be in Rome at that time a deputation of Allobroges,
complaining of grievanoes on the part of Roman commandere·
Through them Lentulus endeavored to engage their nation in the
conspiracy. The Allobroges at first shewed no unwillingness, but
soon realizing the perilous nature of the undertaking, they revealed
to Q. Fabius Sanga, the patron of their nation at Rome, the over-
tnres made ιο them, and he at once informed Cicero. The consul
exhorted the ambassadors to effect great zeal for the enterprise
and to moure documentary proofs of guilt. The Allobroges acted
well their part, and by previous arrangement with Cioero were ar·
rested, with. Volturoius, one of the conspirators, as they were
orossing the Mulvium bridge. The oonsul then eonvened the sen-
ate, and, oonfmnting the prinoipal conspirators with the Allobroges,
effeoted a complete diselosure of the plot. The senate then passed
a vote of thanks to Cicero and the praetors Flaoous· and Pomp-
tinus, ordered the conspirator-s into custody, and deoreed a thanks·
giving in Cicero's name. The orator then aseended the Rostra,
and in the following oration, which was delivered Dee. δᾶ, Β. 0.
