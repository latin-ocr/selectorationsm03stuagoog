member of the college of augurs. In B. C. 51 he was ap-
pointed to the proconsular government of Cilicia. At that time
such appointments were eagerly sought as the means of secur-
ing a fortune or of repairing a broken one. But Cicero accept-ed
the appointment with reluctance‚ and his administration was
characterized by such mildness and equity‚ that the grateful
inhabitants would have shown him unusual honors, had he per-
mitted it.

His return to Rome found Caesar and Pompey preparing tc
enter upon the civil war. Caesar was anxious to secure his
services and influence, but after much vacillation he cast his
fortune with Pompey. After the battle of Pharsalia. he re
turned to Italy, not without apprehensions of Caesar’s resent-

even treated him with kindness and respect. Yet Cicero could
regard the conqueror in no other light than asa usurper and
the destroyer of the liberties ⁴of Rome. He therefore ap-
plauded his assassination, and joined the party of the tyran-

for which he soon paid the forfeit of his life. During these
perilous times Cicero displayed a courage truly heroic. Never
did his country stand in so great need of his services. Intel-

labors and struggles were in vain. combinations were in pro-
gress whose development was fraught with ruin to himself and
his cherished hopes. On the formation of the second Trium-
virate‚ Octavian, to gratify Ant-my, allowed the name of Cicero
to be placed on the list of the proscribed. The soldiers of
Antony were soon in pursnit of him, and overtaking him near
his Formian villa, severed his head from his body. The hands
were cut off, and the murderers carried them, with the head,
to Antony, who caused them, in mockery of the triumphs of
his eloquence‚ to be nailed to the Rostra. Thus perished Cicero
in the sixty-fourth year of his age.
