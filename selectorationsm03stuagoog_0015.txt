spiracy of Catiline, the successful suppression of which
secured him the proud title of Pater patriae, and for a time the
highest exaltation with his countrymen. The attainment of
this high office is a most convincing proof of his great in-

· fluence and popularity at the time. For Cicero was a novus

homo, and a deep-rooted prejudice on the part of the hered-
itary aristocracy, who had long monopolized all the high
offices of the state, ever sought to exclude from them any new
man, none of whose ancestors had occupied a curule chair.
The summary punishment of Lentulus, CethEgus‚ and others
of the conspirat-ore, without trial, eventually proved the ruin
of Cicer0‚ and drove him into exile and the deepest gloom and
despondency. His mortal enemy Clodius proposed a bill, that
“whoever had put to death a Roman citizen uncondemned in
due form of trial, should be interdicted from fire and water.”
This bill was aimed directly at Cicero, for as consul and pre-
siding officer of the senate he was held responsible for their
acts. Cicero ant-icipated the blow and retired to Thessalonica
in a most miserable and melancholy state of mind. The
greatness of his fall completely crushed his spirit. His was
not that firm'and resolute spirit. which endures sudden mis-
fortune with stoical fortitude. His great foible was vanity
and an immoderate estimate of the value of his services. He
was extravagantly fond of praise, and as fearful of censure,
and could bear anything better than the loss of popular ap-
plause. In a letter to his wife Terentia, he says: ‘⁸ O! lost and
affiicted as Ι am, why should Ι ask you to come to me? Yet
must I not ask you? Can 1 then exist without you? But
what will become of my darling Tullia? And my Cicero, what
will he do? I cannot write more—my grief preventa me.”

After enduring a banishment of sixteen months, and through
the untiring exertions of his friends, a bill for the recall of
Cicero was passed in an immense assembly of the people in the
Campus Martius. His journey to Rome was one continued ova·

tion, magistrates and people along his route flocking to see him
and offer their congratulatione.

shortly after his return, in B. Ο. 53, he was appointed a
