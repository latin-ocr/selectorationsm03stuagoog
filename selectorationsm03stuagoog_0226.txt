Fortunately for Rome, Cicero was one of the consuls for that
year, and through Fulvia, mistress of Curius, one of the conspir-
ators, he was promptly informed of all their proceedings. The
consul summoned the senate to meet in the temple of Jupiter
Stator on the 8th of November B. C. 63, and had doubtless in-
tended to disclose the startling nature of the conspiracy, and to
urge measures for protection. Great were the astonishment and
indignation of both Cicero and the senate at beholding Catiline
taking a seat in their midst; for having been praetor he was

entitled to sit in the senate. 'l'he conspiracy hadbeen in pro·
gress for some time, and both the senate anddeading men of
Rome were suspicions of his designs. It was under these circum-
stances and under the promptings of his indignant feelings that
Cicero arose and delivered the following oration.
