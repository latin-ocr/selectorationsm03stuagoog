INTRODUGTION.

DECIMUS BRUTUS, being unable to keep the field, withdrew to
Mutina, where he was besieged by Antony. Cicero now endea-
vored to prevail upon the senate to proclaim Antony a publio
enemy, but that-body determined first to try the milder measure of
sending an embassy to him. Three senators of consular rank,
Servius Sulpicius, Lucius Piso, and Lucius Philippus, were there-
fore sent to demand of Antony the abandonment of the siege of
Mutina, and all other hostilities in Cisalpine Gaul, and his sub-
mission to the authority of the senate3 failing in which he was to
be declared an enemy to the state. Before they reached Antony's
camp, Servius Sulpicius died. He was the first lawyer in Rome,
had filled all the high offices of state, and had long been the inti·
mate friend of Cicero. When tidings of his death reached Rome,
the consul Pansa brought before the senate the question of paying
honors to his memory, and suggested a public funeral and a publio
statue. In the following oration, which was delivered on the loth
of March, B. O. 43, Cicero supports the proposition of the consul,
declarin g that, though Sulpicius had not been killed while employed
on the embassy‚ the embassy was the cause of his death. He con-
cluded by moving that a bronze statue, a public funeral, and a
tomb, at the public expense, should be decreed in honor of Sul-

 

‘⁷ picius. A resolution in these terms was adopted by the senate.
