ΤΟ ΤΗΒ

ΟΒΑΤΙΟΝ AGAINST VERRES.

 

INTRODUCTION.

cmm Vanus, whose name has become a by· word for oppression
and misi-ule, in B. O. 73 had the island of Sicily allotted to him as
his province, and he held the government for three years. During
that long period the wretched inhabitants were the victims of his
rapacity and cruelty. He plundered the towns of their works of
art, sparing neither the temples of the gods nor the private dwell-
ings of men. Statues, and pictures, and jewelled cups were torn
from their owners and appropriated to himself. He imposed heavy
duties upon the produce of the land and the experts of commerce,
and secured to himself the proceeds. Roman citizens were thrown

³ into a dungeon and kept in chains until they were strangled by
his orders; and though one of them, named Gavius, while being
scourged, exclaimed Civis Romanus enm! it did not save him from
being crucified in full view of Italy.

To bring this great criminal to justice, a deputation from nearly
all the principal cities of Sicily was sent to Rome, and as Cicero
had been quaestor at Lilybaeum in B. O. 7 5, he consented, at their
solicitation, to conduct the prosecution. But Quintus Caecilius
Niger, a creature of Verres, who had been his quaestor in Sicily,
asserted his right to be the prosecutor, his object being to make
the prosecution a sham. Cicero then delivered the oration in an-
cilium, and the court having decided the question in his favor, he
was allowed one hundred and ten days to collect the evidence. By
assiduous labor, however, Cicero accomplished the task in fifty
days, and was ready to open the impeachment. The various
devices by which Verres now endeavored to have the trial delayed
until the following year, are fully set forth in the following oration.

At this period (B. C. 70) the Judices were selected exclusively
from the senators. The court met in the temple of Castor, and
Glabrio, the city praetor, was president. The trial began on
the 5th of August, B. Ο. 70, on which day the following oration
was delivered. It was an exciting and memorable scene. “ From
