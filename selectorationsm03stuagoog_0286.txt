INTRODUCTION.

ΤΚΒ leading characters presented in this oration are P. medius
Pulcher and Τ. Annius Milo. Clodius was chiefly instrumental in
procuring the banishment of Cicero, while to Milo the orator was
largely indebted for his recall. The circumstances leading to these
results are briefly these. In B. C. 62 the mysteries of the Bona
Dea, to which no male creature was ever admitted, were celebrated
in the house of Julius Caesar. But Clodius, who, though descended
from one of the noblest families of Rome, was a despiser of gods
and men and the slave of degrading vices, gained admission to
these myster-ies, disguised in woman's apparel, and hoped to escape

 

 

detection; but on being betrayed by his voice, immediately ssed
from the house. For this act of sacrilege he was called to trial, ¹

and as Cicero gave important testimony against him, he became
the orntor's implacable enemy.

In Β. C. 57 Milo was tribune of the people‚ and proved as ener-
getic in securing the recall of Cicero as Clodius had been in effect·
ing his banishment. Both were violent and unscrupulous meno
and hence arose that memorablc contest between them which ended
in the death of Clodius. Eaeh went attended by a body of ‚mod
attendants, and the streets of Rome were the scene of almost dnn!
