FOURTH PHILIPPIC.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Tun union of Octavian with the party of the senate, and the
desertion of two legions from Autony, induced the latter to march
into Cisalpine Gaul, which, since the death of Caesar, had besu
occupied by Decimus Brutus the conspirator. Brutus declared his
resolution to support the authority of the senate by holding that
province against Anfouy, whose situation had now become critical.
Cicero then addressed the senate, and in the third Philippic de-
nounced Antony as a public enemy, praised Octavian for his spirit
aud energy, declared that Decimus Brutus had deserved well of the
state, and concluded by proposing public thanks to these leaders
and to the legions that had deserted from Antony.

From the senate Cicero went immediately to the Forum and

delivered the fourth Philippic to the largest audience that had 1

ever listened to his speeches. He recapitulated the subjecte upon
which he had enlarged in his speech before the senate, giving the
people an account of what had happened, and declaring‚ that, though
Antony had not been formally declared a public enemy by the senate,
he was in effect treated by them as such. The oration, which was
delivered December 2oth, B. C. 44, was so well received, that, speak-
ing of it iu the sixth Philippic, he declares “ he would have reaped
sufficient fruit from the exertions of his whole life, had he died on
the day it was pronounced‚ when the whole people, with one voice
and mind, called out that he had twice saved the republic.”
