ΤΟ THE

SEOOND ORATION AGAINST CATILINE.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Ar the close of the preceding oration, Catiline arose and at-
tempted a vindication of himself, but was interrupted with eries
of “ enemy ’³ and “ parricide.’' He left Rome the same night, giving
out that he was going into voluntary banishment at Marseilles.
His real destination, however, was the camp of Manlius in Etruria.
On the departure of the conspirator, many of the citizens blamed
Cicero for having suffered him to eseape; while the friends of Cati-
liue were equally severe against the consul for having, as they
alleged, driven an innocent man into exile. Cicero therefore deter-
mined to address the Roman people in order to justify his course.

The second oration was delivered in the Forum on the oth of
November Β. C. 63.
