FOURTH ORATION AGAINST GA'HL'INE.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Crctno next assembled the senate in the temple of Concord, and
referred to that body the question of the punishment of the con-
spirators. D. Junius Silanus, consul elect, and others, spoke in
favor of capital punishment. But C. Julius Caesar having advo-
eated the milder mensures of confiscation of property and per-
petual imprisonmcnt, won over to his views a large maJority os the
senate. At this point Cicero arose, and while he artfully appears
to be neutral, yet, b'y painting the dangers of the conspiracy in
strong colors, discloses his preference for extreme mensures. His
speech produced the desired effect. The senate ordered the exe·-
cution of the criminals, and they were strangled the same night
in the subterranean dungeon, Tullianum. Catiline himself fell in
battle near Pistoris„ early in B. C. 62, and most of his followers
shared his fate.

The fourth oration was delivered on the nones or 5th of Decem-
ber B. C. 63, a. day which Cicero ever regarded as the proudest of
his life. The Nonae Decembres formed a bright spot in his mem·
ory. and frequent allusione to it are found in his writings.
