ΤΟ THE

ORATION FOR MARCELLUS. ¹⁸

 

INTRODUGTIpN.

Anemo those who, with Cicero, opposed the ambitious views ol
Caesar and joined the party of Pompey, was Marcus Marcellus,
consul in B. C. 51. His opposition to Caesar had been conducted
with considerable animosity, and therefore, after the battle of
Pharsalia, his proud spirit refused to ask for the conqueror's clem-
ency, and he retired to Mitylene. But though Marcellus himself
would take no steps to procure his recall, his friends at Rome, and
Cicero in particular, were anxious for his restoration 3 and at
length, in a full assembly of the senate, Caius Marcellus, the cousin
of Marcus, in a supplicating posture, implored the pardon of the
illustrious exile, and the whole senate, moved by a common im-
pulse, earnestly joined iu the petition. Though Caesar had, hith-
erto, refused to be reconciled to Marcellus, he now declared that
he could not oppose the unanimous wish of the senate. He there-
fore pronounced a full pax-don. Marcellus, informed of this favor-
able result, set out upon his voyage to Italy, but on his arrival at
Athens he was assassinated by P. Magius Chilo, one of his at-
tendants, from motives of private resentment.

Although Cicero had resolved to speak no more in public, yet
overcome by the generosity of Caesar, he returned thanks in a
speech “ which, though made upon the spot, yet for elegance of
diction, vivacity of sentiment, and politeness of compliment, is
superior to anything extant of the kind in all antiquity.'’

The oration was delivered in the senate in B. Ο. 46, aud was the
first pronounced by the orator after the overthrow of the republic-
