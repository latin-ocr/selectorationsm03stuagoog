NOTES

TO ΤΗΒ

FIRST PHILIPPIG.

 

INTRODUCTION.

Tm! fourteen orations called Philippico were all directed against
Marcus Antonius, the “‚soft triumvir,'' and received their name
from their resemblance to the invectives pronounced by Demos-
thenes against Philip of Macedon. The crisis precipitated by the
assassination of Caesar at first alarmed Cieero for his safety, and
he resolved on a voyage to Greece. After he had set out, he was
detained at Rhegium by contrary winde, and the hope of an accom-
modation between Antony and the senate induced him to return.
This hope was destined not to be realized, for Antony, now holding
the office of consul, was craftily preparing to follow in the footsteps
of Caesar. On the day after his arrival, Antony assembled the
senate for the purpose of seeuring their sanction to some new
honors to the memory of Caesar, and Cicero was specially sum·
moned to be present. He exeused himself, however, alleging fatigue
from his journey3 buton the following day, September 2d, Β. C. 44,
he appeared in his place, in the absence of Antony‚ and delivered
the first Philippic. After explaining the motives of his recent
departure from Rome, his sudden return, his absence en the pre-
ceding day, and declar-ing that he would have opposed the post-
humous honors proposed to the usurper, he defended the laws of
Caesar, and warned the senate of the designs of Antony, who had
violated the most authentic of those laws.

This oration produced an open rupture between Cicero and An-
tony. They became the principal characters at Rome. Never
before did Rome stand in such need of the orator's services», and
never did he appear to better advantage than during this perilous
crisis. The emergency of the occasion overcame his constitutional

' timidity, and he again became the popular idol. The image of the
old republic filled his mind and animated him with a noble spirit
Of patriotism. But his labors and counsels were in vain. Those
combinatione were in progress which resulted· in the Second Tri-
umvirate, and in his proscription and death, as related iu the sketch
0f his life. The first four Philippics were delivered in the latter
Ptrt of the year B. C. 44, and the last ten early in B. C. 43.
