aelf-reliance. He is justly charged with excessivo vanity and
an inordinate love of praise. The applause of his countrymen
possessed a charm for him that nothing else could bestow.

of which he was so fond a votary, failed to yield him the needed
consolation.

But in his private character and domestic relations Cicero
was a beautiful pattern of virtue, temperance, and purity, in
an age characterized by much irreligion, vice, and immorality.
He was a devoted husband, an affectionate father, a kind and
obliging friend. “Those great occasions when he was com-
pelled to act on his own responsibility, and to listen to the
dictates of his beautiful soul, ‘seim sckb‘ne Seele' (Niebuhr), his
pure, honest, and incorruptible heart. are the bright points in
Cicero’s character. Gentle‚ sympathizing‚ and affectionate, he
lived as a patriot. and died as a philosopher.'' (Browne’s Rom.
C'las. Lit.)

Cicero was a singulm-ly voluminous writer. His works em-
brace almost every department of literature. His letters to
Atticus and others arc particularly valuable in unfolding many
political complexities of his time. He is the representative
of the best age of Latin prose, and contributed more than any
other writer to enriching and perfectnng the language, and 'm
rendering it smooth, flexible, and harmonicus.
